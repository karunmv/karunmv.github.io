  aboutMe:
    "I have been passionate about robotics since I was 9 years old and have been pursuing that goal ever since. From attending a camp that piqued my interest in this field, to tinkering with Arduinos to make small bots of my own, to now working on industrial and research projects in reputed institutions, I have constantly strived to broaden my horizons and challenge myself to solve bigger and harder problems. I have established myself as a reliable leader capable of managing teams ranging from 10-50 members and efficiently solving problems using that man power to successfully complete the project in hand.",
